<h1>Hex change background color</h1>

<h2>About the project</h2>

<p>
    This is a really small project on my journey to learn HTML, CSS, and JS. 
    This project consists of a single button that when clicked, changes the color of the entire background, i.e., from the <em></em>body tag</em>. When the button is clicked, it calls a function to randomly select a <em>hex</em> color and it changes the inner HTML of tag <em>h1</em> in order to display the hex color code.
