              <li><b>1888</b> - he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now know as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium).</li>
              <li><b>1891</b> - he independently discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem (at age of 12)</li>
              <li><b>1894</b> - his family move to Italy, but he stays in Munich to finish his studies.</li>
              <li><b>1895</b> - at the age of 16, Einstein took entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich. He failed to reach the required standad in the general part of the examination. However, he obtained execptional grades in physics and mathematics.
              <li><b>1896</b> - with his father's approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military service.</li>
              <li><b>1896</b> - he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Zürich polytechnic school.
              <li><b>1900</b> - he graduated and spent almost two years searching for a teaching post. He published a paper <i>"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen"</i> ("Conclusion from the Capilarity Phenomena")</li> 
              <li><b>1901</b> - he acquired Swiss citizenship.</li>
              <li><b>1902</b> - einstein started a small discussion group with Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which they met regularly to discuss science and philosophy.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li><b>1903</b> - his position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent.</li>
              <li><b>1905</b> - Einstein completed his thesis and, as a result, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich, with his dissrtation <i>A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions.</i> This year is also known as the <i>annus mirabilis</i>, because he published four groundbreaking papers:
              <li class="sub-item">On the Photoelectric Effect</li>
              <li class="sub-item">On The Brownian Motion</li>
              <li class="sub-item">On the special relativity</li>
              <li class="sub-item">On the Equivalence of Mass and Energy</li>
              </li>
            <li><b>1908</b> - he was invited to teach theoretical physics at the University of Bern.</li>
            <li><b>1909</b> - Einstein moved to the University of Zürich.</li>
            <li><b>1911</b> - he was in Charles University in Prague.</li>
            <li><b>1912</b> - Einstein returns to the Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich.</li>
            <li><b>1914</b> - he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, where he remained for 19 years.</li>
            <li><b>1916</b> - Einstein publishes a paper on general relativity, introducing his theory of gravitation.</li>
            <li><b>1917</b> - he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.</li>
            <li><b>1922</b> - he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect."</li>
            <li><b>1955</b> - he died in Princeton, New Jersey, United States.</li>
