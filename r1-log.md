# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Your Name Here]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 29, Monday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. Already went through the HTML basics. Hope to do more than one hour a day so I can finish this course within the 100 days.

### R1D2
I concluded the ``Basic CSS`` tutorial in the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. Details about this day can be found in [log.md](log.md) file.

### R1D3
I continued the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. Learn a little more about what CSS properties can do and applied some of these properties into the raw HTML of [D1 project](projects/D1). The styled HTML can be found into the [D3](projects/D3) folder.

### R1D4
I continued the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. I have learn a little bit more about text styling. I was amazed by the simplicity of using ``hover``. Still struggling to understand the value ``absolute`` from the variable ``position``. Started to learn the basics about color theory, already have learned about the color wheel and how using hex made it very clear how colors can cancel each other.

### R1D5
I continued the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. Kept learning about color theory applying it to simple divs using CSS stylesheet. I also learn how to import a custom CSS into my Jupyter Notebook, answering a question in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) on how to do this. I was mistaken by a bot since I created a profile just to answer this.

### R1D6
linear-gradient() function is simply amazing and easy to use. I always thought that a feature like this would take several lines of code to be accomplished. Still have to properly learn the pseudo properties ``::before`` and ``::after``. 

### R1D7
Learn a little about animations. Simple properties like ``animation-name``, ``animation-duration``, and ``animation-fill-mode``. The ``animation-name`` is passed to the ``@keyframes`` for the commands regarding the animation take place in that particular element. The ``animation-duration`` is quite obvious what it is and the ``animation-fill-mode`` dictates the final state of the object after the animation has finished. ``animation-iteration-count`` is also quite nice and produce a nice effect.

### R1D8
Went through some of the items in ``Applied Accessibility`` section in **freeCodeCamp**. I have never thought about how text elements should be clear, not just to make your site/idea direct and simple, but also to provide accessibility. Guess I am learning more than how to code doing this chalenge.

### R1D9
Still studying the topics of ``Applied Accessibility`` in **freeCodeCamp**. Learned about figures, fieldset and how they can put elements together. This helps interpret the things that belong together, like a image and its caption, or some radio buttons that belong to a certain category. 

### R1D10
Finished the ``Applied Accessibility`` section in **freeCodeCamp**. Finally learn how to make elements navigable by your keyboard: using ``accesskey`` to provide a key (e.g. "c") or ``tabindex`` using integers. 

### R1D11
I was studying ``Responsive Web Design Principles`` at **freeCodeCamp**. Manage to learn how to properly resize an image according to the device being used by using the ``@media`` to pass conditions before applying a CSS style. This lesson is pretty cool and helped me to fix an image display in other project. However, I couldn't go through it because my code doesn't get validate on the third Challenge.
