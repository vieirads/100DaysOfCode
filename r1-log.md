## Log

### R1D1 
Started the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. Already went through the HTML basics. Hope to do more than one hour a day so I can finish this course within the 100 days.

### R1D2
I concluded the ``Basic CSS`` tutorial in the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. Details about this day can be found in [log.md](log.md) file.

### R1D3
I continued the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. Learn a little more about what CSS properties can do and applied some of these properties into the raw HTML of [D1 project](projects/D1). The styled HTML can be found into the [D3](projects/D3) folder.

### R1D4
I continued the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. I have learn a little bit more about text styling. I was amazed by the simplicity of using ``hover``. Still struggling to understand the value ``absolute`` from the variable ``position``. Started to learn the basics about color theory, already have learned about the color wheel and how using hex made it very clear how colors can cancel each other.
