# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Your Name Here]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 29, Monday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. Already went through the HTML basics. Hope to do more than one hour a day so I can finish this course within the 100 days.

### R1D2
I concluded the ``Basic CSS`` tutorial in the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. Details about this day can be found in [log.md](log.md) file.

### R1D3
I continued the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. Learn a little more about what CSS properties can do and applied some of these properties into the raw HTML of [D1 project](projects/D1). The styled HTML can be found into the [D3](projects/D3) folder.

### R1D4
I continued the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. I have learn a little bit more about text styling. I was amazed by the simplicity of using ``hover``. Still struggling to understand the value ``absolute`` from the variable ``position``. Started to learn the basics about color theory, already have learned about the color wheel and how using hex made it very clear how colors can cancel each other.

### R1D5
I continued the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. Kept learning about color theory applying it to simple divs using CSS stylesheet. I also learn how to import a custom CSS into my Jupyter Notebook, answering a question in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) on how to do this. I was mistaken by a bot since I created a profile just to answer this.

### R1D6
linear-gradient() function is simply amazing and easy to use. I always thought that a feature like this would take several lines of code to be accomplished. Still have to properly learn the pseudo properties ``::before`` and ``::after``. 

### R1D7
Learn a little about animations. Simple properties like ``animation-name``, ``animation-duration``, and ``animation-fill-mode``. The ``animation-name`` is passed to the ``@keyframes`` for the commands regarding the animation take place in that particular element. The ``animation-duration`` is quite obvious what it is and the ``animation-fill-mode`` dictates the final state of the object after the animation has finished. ``animation-iteration-count`` is also quite nice and produce a nice effect.

### R1D8
Went through some of the items in ``Applied Accessibility`` section in **freeCodeCamp**. I have never thought about how text elements should be clear, not just to make your site/idea direct and simple, but also to provide accessibility. Guess I am learning more than how to code doing this chalenge.

### R1D9
Still studying the topics of ``Applied Accessibility`` in **freeCodeCamp**. Learned about figures, fieldset and how they can put elements together. This helps interpret the things that belong together, like a image and its caption, or some radio buttons that belong to a certain category. 

### R1D10
Finished the ``Applied Accessibility`` section in **freeCodeCamp**. Finally learn how to make elements navigable by your keyboard: using ``accesskey`` to provide a key (e.g. "c") or ``tabindex`` using integers. 

### R1D11
I was studying ``Responsive Web Design Principles`` at **freeCodeCamp**. Manage to learn how to properly resize an image according to the device being used by using the ``@media`` to pass conditions before applying a CSS style. This lesson is pretty cool and helped me to fix an image display in other project. However, I couldn't go through it because my code doesn't get validate on the third Challenge. 

### R1D12
Today I worked on some elements of my introductory python course's page. I applied some CSS to make display figures in a nicer way and also modified the mark tag, adding an animation using ``@keyframes`` that make the background change colors when you hover. 

### R1D13
 Fixed the problem I was having with the challenge in "Responsive Web Design Principles" by using Firefox. Also went through the flexbox section of **freeCodeCamp**. Despite the concept being simple and straightforward, I still have some practice to do. 

It is pretty cool and simple how the elements can change according to simple commands, such as ``flex-shrink`` and ``flex-grow``. For the elements respond to such properties, they should be child of a tag with a CSS property ``display: flex``. You can also change the orientation of the elements (vertical or horizontal) and tell how they should be placed.

### R1D14
Today I started the CSS Grids challenges at **freCodeCamp**. So far it is going pretty smooth. You have to set up the parent tag with ``display: grid;`` and then you can use its properties, such as, ``grid-template-columns`` and ``grid-template-rows``. For the child tags you have properties like ``grid-column`` and ``grid-row``. These properties are responsible to span the element from the n-th line to the (m-1)-th. For instance, ``grid-column: 3/5;`` will span the child element from column 3 to 4. You can also align the items by using the ``justify-self`` and ``align-self`` for columns and rows, respectivelly.

### R1D15
Finished the CSS Grids challenges. Learned more about how we can align all the items horizontally or vertically within the grid by using ``justify-items`` and ``align-items``, respectivelly. Also learned how you can group items within an area that you create within the grid. To accomplish this we can use ``grid-area`` and create areas using whatever name you want, considering the numbers of columns and rows of your grid. Learned how you can resize the elements within the container to make them look good. The details about this day can be gound in [log.md](log.md).

### R1D16
Applied some CSS style to my Jupyter Notebooks to highligh ``exercices`` and ``answers`` cells. Started the project at **freeCodeCamp** where I have to design a ``Tribute Page``. I also download an app on my phone to practice whenever I have to kill time.

### R1D17
I wrote a bit on my <a href="https://bit.ly/2OGHooJ" target="_blank">Tribute page</a> as a project for the freeCodeCamp. I hope I get this done by tomorrow. I just have to put some text and some style ideas I have. 

### R1D18
Put some CSS style on my <a href="https://bit.ly/2OGHooJ" target="_blank">Tribute page</a> (freeCodeCamp project). Trying to implement some custom styling into another page together with a friend.

### R1D19
Worked a bit with div tags and how to make children fit within their parent's limits.

### R1D20
Create a Survey form as the second project of Responsive Web Design from **freeCodeCamp**. Worked on my HTML and CSS beginner skills.

### R1D21
Finally updated <a href="https://vieirads.github.io">GitHub page</a> with what I learned of `HTML` and `CSS` so far. Still have a lot of content to add, but it is something already.

### R1D22
Kept working on my <a href="https://vieirads.github.io">GitHub page</a>. Tried to implement `grid` and `flexbox` into some components. I also tried to use `@media` queries in order to make the size of the elements and fonts responsive.

### R1D23
Studied and reproduced the Portfolio example by **freeCodeCamp**. I wrote the CSS trying to understand what each property would do. It was a good exercise.

### R1D24
Started to study JavaScript at **freeCodeCamp**. I want to learn more about how the dynamics of the pages work, and, of course, how can I implement them.

Going throught the begginer's part. So far it is ok, since I already studied this part once.
