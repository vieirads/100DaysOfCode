# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Your Name Here]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 29, Monday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. Already went through the HTML basics. Hope to do more than one hour a day so I can finish this course within the 100 days.

### R1D2
I concluded the ``Basic CSS`` tutorial in the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. Details about this day can be found in [log.md](log.md) file.

### R1D3
I continued the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. Learn a little more about what CSS properties can do and applied some of these properties into the raw HTML of [D1 project](projects/D1). The styled HTML can be found into the [D3](projects/D3) folder.

### R1D4
I continued the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. I have learn a little bit more about text styling. I was amazed by the simplicity of using ``hover``. Still struggling to understand the value ``absolute`` from the variable ``position``. Started to learn the basics about color theory, already have learned about the color wheel and how using hex made it very clear how colors can cancel each other.

### R1D5
I continued the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" alt="Link to FreeCodeCamp.">Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours)</a>. Kept learning about color theory applying it to simple divs using CSS stylesheet. I also learn how to import a custom CSS into my Jupyter Notebook, answering a question in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) on how to do this. I was mistaken by a bot since I created a profile just to answer this.

### R1D6
linear-gradient() function is simply amazing and easy to use. I always thought that a feature like this would take several lines of code to be accomplished. Still have to properly learn the pseudo properties ``::before`` and ``::after``. 

### R1D7
Learn a little about animations. Simple properties like ``animation-name``, ``animation-duration``, and ``animation-fill-mode``. The ``animation-name`` is passed to the ``@keyframes`` for the commands regarding the animation take place in that particular element. The ``animation-duration`` is quite obvious what it is and the ``animation-fill-mode`` dictates the final state of the object after the animation has finished. ``animation-iteration-count`` is also quite nice and produce a nice effect.

### R1D8
Went through some of the items in ``Applied Accessibility`` section in **freeCodeCamp**. I have never thought about how text elements should be clear, not just to make your site/idea direct and simple, but also to provide accessibility. Guess I am learning more than how to code doing this chalenge.

### R1D9
Still studying the topics of ``Applied Accessibility`` in **freeCodeCamp**. Learned about figures, fieldset and how they can put elements together. This helps interpret the things that belong together, like a image and its caption, or some radio buttons that belong to a certain category. 

### R1D10
Finished the ``Applied Accessibility`` section in **freeCodeCamp**. Finally learn how to make elements navigable by your keyboard: using ``accesskey`` to provide a key (e.g. "c") or ``tabindex`` using integers. 

### R1D11
I was studying ``Responsive Web Design Principles`` at **freeCodeCamp**. Manage to learn how to properly resize an image according to the device being used by using the ``@media`` to pass conditions before applying a CSS style. This lesson is pretty cool and helped me to fix an image display in other project. However, I couldn't go through it because my code doesn't get validate on the third Challenge. 

### R1D12
Today I worked on some elements of my introductory python course's page. I applied some CSS to make display figures in a nicer way and also modified the mark tag, adding an animation using ``@keyframes`` that make the background change colors when you hover. 

### R1D13
 Fixed the problem I was having with the challenge in "Responsive Web Design Principles" by using Firefox. Also went through the flexbox section of **freeCodeCamp**. Despite the concept being simple and straightforward, I still have some practice to do. 

It is pretty cool and simple how the elements can change according to simple commands, such as ``flex-shrink`` and ``flex-grow``. For the elements respond to such properties, they should be child of a tag with a CSS property ``display: flex``. You can also change the orientation of the elements (vertical or horizontal) and tell how they should be placed.

### R1D14
Today I started the CSS Grids challenges at **freCodeCamp**. So far it is going pretty smooth. You have to set up the parent tag with ``display: grid;`` and then you can use its properties, such as, ``grid-template-columns`` and ``grid-template-rows``. For the child tags you have properties like ``grid-column`` and ``grid-row``. These properties are responsible to span the element from the n-th line to the (m-1)-th. For instance, ``grid-column: 3/5;`` will span the child element from column 3 to 4. You can also align the items by using the ``justify-self`` and ``align-self`` for columns and rows, respectivelly.

### R1D15
Finished the CSS Grids challenges. Learned more about how we can align all the items horizontally or vertically within the grid by using ``justify-items`` and ``align-items``, respectivelly. Also learned how you can group items within an area that you create within the grid. To accomplish this we can use ``grid-area`` and create areas using whatever name you want, considering the numbers of columns and rows of your grid. Learned how you can resize the elements within the container to make them look good. The details about this day can be gound in [log.md](log.md).

### R1D16
Applied some CSS style to my Jupyter Notebooks to highligh ``exercices`` and ``answers`` cells. Started the project at **freeCodeCamp** where I have to design a ``Tribute Page``. I also download an app on my phone to practice whenever I have to kill time.

### R1D17
I wrote a bit on my <a href="https://bit.ly/2OGHooJ" target="_blank">Tribute page</a> as a project for the freeCodeCamp. I hope I get this done by tomorrow. I just have to put some text and some style ideas I have. 

### R1D18
Put some CSS style on my <a href="https://bit.ly/2OGHooJ" target="_blank">Tribute page</a> (freeCodeCamp project). Trying to implement some custom styling into another page together with a friend.

### R1D19
Worked a bit with div tags and how to make children fit within their parent's limits.

### R1D20
Create a Survey form as the second project of Responsive Web Design from **freeCodeCamp**. Worked on my HTML and CSS beginner skills.

### R1D21
Finally updated <a href="https://vieirads.github.io">GitHub page</a> with what I learned of `HTML` and `CSS` so far. Still have a lot of content to add, but it is something already.

### R1D22
Kept working on my <a href="https://vieirads.github.io">GitHub page</a>. Tried to implement `grid` and `flexbox` into some components. I also tried to use `@media` queries in order to make the size of the elements and fonts responsive.

### R1D23
Studied and reproduced the Portfolio example by **freeCodeCamp**. I wrote the CSS trying to understand what each property would do. It was a good exercise.

### R1D24
Started to study JavaScript at **freeCodeCamp**. I want to learn more about how the dynamics of the pages work, and, of course, how can I implement them.

Going throught the begginer's part. So far it is ok, since I already studied this part once.

### R1D25
Studied a bit more of JavaScript at **freeCodeCamp** and read some things about CSS, which made me learn about depth of properties of classes: simple stuff, but I didn't know about it.

### R1D26
Finished the Basic JavaScript at **freeCodeCamp**.

### R1D27
Studied a little CSS and JavaScript.

### R1D28
Finished the ES6 section at **freeCodeCamp**. Also started to read about jQuery. Still haven't figure out what is the deal with Promises.

### R1D29
Went through the Bootstrap and jQuery sections of **freeCodeCamp**. Bootstrap is very helpful and have everything ready for use and it is totally responsive. Learn the basics of jQuery, but I still need more content to do the stuff I want o my page. Pretty cool stuff and easy to use.

### R1D30
Went through the Sass section of **freeCodeCamp** and started the React one. I think I have seen enough for now. Tomorrow I will start building small projects.

### R131
Wrote a little code in python today for a project. Also, started creating simple projects using HTML, CSS, and JS. Made a simple page with a button that changes the background color when clicked.

### R1D32
Made two applications using HTML, CSS, and JS:
- First one changes the color of the background and display the Hex code of the color;
- Second one is a random quote generator, that also changes the color of the elements using a single color or a mix of colors.

### R1D33
Started another little project where you type a message and it is displayed somewhere else. Following this list of projects [here](https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/) in order to learn HTML, CSS, and JS.

## R1D34
Mande a simple counter app using HTML, CSS, and JS. Learning how to deal with event listener.

### R1D35
Started a new project that consists of a simple image slider. Did not finish it yet.

### R1D36
Made a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code is on an app on my phone, but tomorrow I am going to put it on files in a project folder.

### R1D37
Worked a bit with python doing some figures. Learned how to select multiple queries using JavaScript just in one line of code. I am going to test this on my calculator and put the code on codepen.

### R1D38
Created an iPhone case with a calculator app that works. Well, it redirects you to the app. I still have to write the JavaScript functions to make the calculator, hmmm, calculate.

### R1D39
Implemented the functionality on the calculator app.

### R1D40
I didn't have time to work with html, css, and javascript today. However I prepared a class about quantitative text analysis (PT) using python. Amazing how texts have universal properties explained by such simple equations.

### R1D41 
Worked a bit with python preparing my class on quantitative text analysis. I manage to code much better than the first time I did such analysis.

### R1D42 
Finished the content of my class on quantitative text analysis using python.

### R1D43
Worked with python on a separated project.

### R1D44
Learning to use ipywidgets together with matplotlib to create a package to edit text on plots.

### R1D45
I was curious about AngularJS. So I followed a tutorial on how to add elements on table. I am going to use it to make a todo list with a timer. So far I understood what is going on.

### R1D46
Progressing in my chores/countdown app using AngularJS. Still grasping the basics and trying to google what I need. So far things are working. Even though I don't know why...
I think I might have to read some basic material first. But, in the event of things keep working, I will continue with this project.

### R1D47
Continued working on my `taskcounter` project. Added several buttons and implemented their functionalities. Now you can add, delete, skip, start, pause, resume and mark the tasks as done.
I have to work on the order of the list as itens are being finished. When they have status 'Done' or 'Skipped' it should go to the end of the tasks marked as 'Queued'.

### R1D48
Worked on my task app. Modified the time display to HH:MM:SS. Learn a little bit about the Date() object: how to set and get its properties.
I was doing several conditions to sum the seconds and minutes in order to display it correctly. But at a certain moment I was pissed and thought: "There has to be an easier way." Using the `Date()` object was the easier way.

### R1D49
Tried to make a countdown for my taskcounter app and could not figure it out. 
Have to better understand the basics of AngularJS.

### R1D50
Studied a bit of AngularJs in codecademy.

### R1D51
Studying on codecaemy, I learned how to format date outputs. This made the code of my `taskcounter` app cleaner and easier to achieve what I wanted. Happy with this progress =)
Sometimes it pays off to study a bit instead of keep "cracking your head" trying things you don't even know how it works.

### R1D52
Added a dropdown to select hours and minutes for the tasks in my `taskcounter` app. Also modified the button skip in case you want to retake the skipped task, however it modifies all the buttons with this property. Have to fix this.

### R1D53
Fixed the display of button `Skip`. Now only the clicked button changes to `Retake`. Create a simple solution involving arrays. The point is to make things work first =)
Still think that there is a better way to solve this issue, but so far this one works.

### R1D54
Worked on my `taskcounter` app. Added a feature where the taskas are grouped by their status. Also, when a task is added, it goes right after the last queued one. I accomplished this simply by using push and splice array methods. 

### R1D55
Manage to make the final time to stop once you click the button start. However, it does not account for the time paused when the button paused is clicked and then resume. Manage to make a countdown for the time in the tasks, but I try to modified it and it does not work anymore.
I have to come back for these countdowns tomorrow and the wrong ellapsase time between paused and resumed.

### R1D56
My `taskcounter` now has the timers working: final time increases until the Start button is clicked. When this event is triggered, the first task starts to decrease its time, which increases the ellapsed time.

### R1D57
I have added a little CSS to the app. Today was full of classes and I did not have enough time to work on my project.
Still have to fix the things mentioned on the `Day 56`.

### R1D58
Added a bit more of CSS to my `taskcounter` app.
Still have to fix the things mentioned on the `Day 56`.

### R1D59
Added some change in style using css when a event is met. The classes and ids are changing based on the return of variables and functions within the angularjs app. These are then found in the css file and the style is applied accordingly.
So far I think it is easier to make effects using this dynamical set of classes and ids using angularjs.

### R1D60
Made changes on the color scheme of the app on the `style.css` file. Had a lot of classes to teach and a meeting to attend.
I wish I could have worked more on my app.

### R1D61
Polished the design of the `taskcounter` app and fixed some bugs. Still have to put an alert message when all the tasks are done.
Pretty proud of what I did =)

### R1D62
Studied a little bit of D3. It is really nice to use and it is very intuitve. So far at least.

### R1D63
Studied a bit of Angular on SoloLearn.
I didn't know that Angular used mainly TypeScript.

### R1D64
Put an alert message in my `taskcounter` app when all the tasks are done. However, the message doesn't go away once I click on the `Ok` button. Have to fix that.
I am working with the oldest version of Angular, which is AngularJS. I have to upgrade this and learn the most recent framework.

### R1D65
Studied a bit of Angular on Sololearn and the topic was how the data travels until it reaches the frontend display.
I still have to study more this structures.

### R1D66
Continued to study Angular on Sololearn. Learned about one-way and two-way data binding.
Some concepts that I know about have specific names. I think I better learn the proper names.

### R1D67
Studied a bit of React. Create a app using the commands in terminal. There are a lot of files that I have no idea what they are intend for. But I will keep things slow and learn the aspects of it bit by bit.

### R1D68
Studied a bit more of react and learn how to create tags using functions and classes.
I still have to find out how to put conditions when I click a button.

### R1D69
Studied a bit of React on Sololearn. Learn a bit about how to use `setState` and `Hooks`
Very tired today. Tomorrow I kee studying.

### R1D70
Studied a bit of React. 
Today I did not study much. I took a day off.

### R1D71
Finished the React section on Sololearn tutorials. Manage to put a message of alert into one of my study projects when a button click event is triggered.
Now that I have some basics, I have to start building something.

### R1D72
Studied a bit of Redux on Sololearn. 
To be very honest, I still don't get the importance of this framework.

### R1D73
Started to learn about `kivy` package on python. I am really liking it. Seems to be fun to work with.
This package has it's own language, which looks like a CSS. You can separate all the GUI in a `.kv` file and all the logic of the app within the `.py` file.

### R1D74
Studied a bit more of Kivy and started to make a simple calculator.
I did a quick design with simples buttons and now I have to write the logic.

### R1D75
Struggled to make the calculator using kivy. Tomorrow I will try again.
I am not having enough time to study the way I wanted, because I have a test next week.

### R1D76
I didn't code today. I had to study for my upcoming test.
I wanted to code, but I had to study for something else right now.

### R1D77

### R1D84
I didn't code today. After the test, I decided to take a day off.
Tomorrow I will be back to coding.

### R1D85
Analyzed a simple experiment of a unidimensional movement with constant speed in python. I used classes to obtain the aceleration of the system using a linear fit.
Tomorrow I will be back to learn kivy.

### R1D86
Today I analyzed the damped harmonic oscilator using python. I also continued my studies on kivy (finally!).
I hope to finish my calculator using kivy by the end of this week.

### R1D87
Studied a bit more of kivy and manage to make my calculator app work. It does simple operations.
I tried to implement trigonometric functions, but there was an error occurring with the packages. I will learn more about this tomorrow.

### R1D88
Studied a bit more of kivy
Still have to figure out how to use other packages with kivy.

### R1D89
Studied a bit more of kivy.

### R1D90
Studied a bit more of kivy.

### R1D91
Studied a bit more of kivy.

### R1D92
Studied a bit more of kivy. Started creating my todo app. Already include a screen where you can add and delete tasks.
Kivy language is quite similar to HTML and CSS.

### R1D93
Studied a bit more of kivy. Continued my todo app. I have included transition of screens using the ScreenViewer and Screen objects. I also included a keyboard event using the `esc` key (code equal the number 27), which is used to account for the `return` button in an android system.
So far I am using everything from a tutorial adding a little more stuff to it. 

### R1D94
Studied a bit more of kivy. Continued my todo app. I have added one more option: `Pomodoro`. In the main menu you can select this option and it will redirect you to another screen which has a pomodoro task counter, still not working though. I also learned how to create templates on kivy language using the <MyTemplate@Object1+Object2> where `MyTemplate` is the name you want to use to have the same properties and `Object1` and `Object2` are the objects of which you want to use the properties. This make the code cleaner.
So far I am using everything from a tutorial adding a little more stuff to it, like, today, I manage to create a nicer button from what a learned on the tutorial.
